Hypercar
A more recent term for high-performance sportscars is "hypercar", which is sometimes used to describe the highest performing supercars.[16] As per supercars, there is no set definition for what constitutes a hypercar. An attempt to define these is "a limited-production, top-of-the-line supercar with a price of around or more than US$1 million."[17]

Some people consider the 1993 McLaren F1 to be the first hypercar,[18] while others believe the 2005 Bugatti Veyron was the first hypercar.[19]

Many recent hypercars use a hybrid drivetrain, a trend started in 2013 by the McLaren P1, Porsche 918 Spyder, and LaFerrari. [20][21][22]
