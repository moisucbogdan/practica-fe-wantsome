During the 1960s, cars that are now considered to be muscle cars were then referred to as supercars.[9][10](p8) The term was often (though not always) spelled with a capital S.[11] In 1966 the sixties supercar became an official industry trend.[9](p8) For example, the May 1965 issue of the American magazine Car Life includes multiple references to supercars and "the supercar club"[12] and a 1968 issue of Car & Driver magazine refers to "the Supercar street racer gang" market segment.[13] In the model name of the AMC S/C Rambler, the "S/C" is an abbreviation for "SuperCar".[14]

Since the decline of the muscle car in the 1970s, the word supercar came to mean a car in the mold of a Lamborghini or Ferrari.[9](p5) Other interpretations of the term are for limited-production models produced by small manufacturers for enthusiasts, and standard-looking cars modified for increased performance.[15]
