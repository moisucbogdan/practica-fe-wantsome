he Lamborghini Miura, produced from 1966â€“1973, is often said to be the first supercar.[1][2][3][4] By the 1970s and 1980s the term was in regular use, if not precisely defined.[5][6] One interpretation up until the 1990s was to use it for mid-engine two-seat cars with at least eight cylinders (but typically a V12 engine), a power output of at least 400 bhp (298 kW) and a top speed of at least 180 mph (290 km/h).[7] Other interpretations state that "it must be very fast, with sporting handling to match", "it should be sleek and eye-catching" and its price should be "one in a rarefied atmosphere of its own"[8] or regard exclusivity (i.e. limited production volumes) as an important characteristic.[4]

It is also claimed that the definition of a supercar has always been subjective and a matter of blind prejudice.[7]
